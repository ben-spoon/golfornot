Golf Or Not?
=========
Determines if the weather is suitable to play golf or not 
## How it decides
The answer, at the moment, is based on a few things:
* Temp
  * Under 60 degrees? Eh... could be better.
* "Feels like" Temp
  * Feels like it is under 60? Pssssh
* Wind
  * This one is kinda buggy. It really is only addressing the wind *gusts*. So it doesn't account for the wind in general, yet.
* Time
  * Past 6pm - no golf
  * Before 4pm? Get a whole 18 in.
  * Past 3pm but before 6pm? 9 holes is probably for you.
  * Before 6am? Stop being awake and wait to golf...
